As we begin a new phase in the **Blockchain industry**, it's important to ask:

> Where are we in the **development stage**? What are the **trends** driving dapps to achieve **Mass Adoption**?

**Web 2** meant *social media*, *APIs*, and the *internet of things*. People of all ages switched from PDAs and desktops to using the internet on small devices. Even your grandma could be seen posting bold comments on Facebook. Web 2 changed how people **adopted technology** while keeping it **easy to use**.

The average user is aware of the latest tech. They are very familiar with the internet and common technology. **Web 3** is struggling with big **UX problems** because users are used to very simple apps.

**Aptimus** was born to **simplify this journey**
